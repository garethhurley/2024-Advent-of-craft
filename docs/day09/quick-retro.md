# Quick Retro

## What did you learn?

- Perhaps a Builder is the most readable solution?
- I overcame the documenting the magic boolean problem differently - less elegant but simpler.

## What puzzles do you have?

- Is a Builder overkill here?  We are only playing with two changing inputs?
- the GiftRequest does not feel like it belongs as part of Child.  They are different concepts.
